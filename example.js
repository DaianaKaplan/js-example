// To use the VS code debugger, first click on the "pages" icon in the top left
// Then click "open folder" and open the folder that this file is in

// Now, we can run the .js file from within VS code. Click the "play" button on the top right of the screen and the code below will run

let intro = "hello world";

console.log(intro);

// To use the debugger, go to the terminal on VS code on the bottom and type in "live-server" like we have in the normal terminal

// Now that the live server is running, we can use the debugger: Place a breakpoint here by clicking to the left of the line numbers on the left

// Click the icon on the left that looks like a bug and press the play button on the top to start

// You can see whatever variables have been declared and other useful information in the debug column
